# library_management
A Java-based library management system using object-oriented programming, incorporating features for book and patron management with an emphasis on code organization and reusability.

A library management system implemented in Java, leveraging object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The code employs encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to model and organize various entities within a library, such as books, patrons, and transactions. It provides functionality for tasks like adding and removing books, managing patron information, and handling borrowing and returning processes. The use of OOP facilitates code modularity, reusability, and maintainability, enhancing the overall design of the library management system.
